<pre> I was born in Jerusalem, Israel in 2001. I am of Moroccan and European Descent. This means my family loves huge gatherings
with lots of culturally diverse food, music, and even dance. I moved to Redmond, Washington  when I was 6 years old. Since
I moved, I have integrated another culture into my life.
